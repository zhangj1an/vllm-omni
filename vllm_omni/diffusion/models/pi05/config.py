"""Config surface for the π0.5 VLA model in vllm-omni.

Deliberately shaped exactly like ``pi0/config.py``: a small dataclass that
consumes the raw LeRobot ``config.json`` (the field surface of
``lerobot.policies.pi05.PI05Config``) and keeps only the runtime-relevant
fields. Transformer dimensions are derived from ``paligemma_variant`` /
``action_expert_variant`` inside the model via ``get_gemma_config``.

What π0.5 adds on top of the π0 config surface:

* ``tokenizer_max_length = 200`` (π0 uses 48).
* ``state_num_bins`` — state is discretized into language tokens instead of
  going through a ``state_proj`` layer.
* ``use_relative_actions`` / ``relative_exclude_joints`` /
  ``action_feature_names`` — the relative-action contract. See
  ``processor_pi05.Pi05RelativeActions``.
* Quantile normalization stats. LeRobot's π0.5 defaults ``STATE`` and
  ``ACTION`` to ``NormalizationMode.QUANTILES`` where π0 uses ``MEAN_STD``.

**Checkpoint boundary rule.** A capability that the checkpoint *declares* but
this implementation does not *consume* must raise, not be silently dropped.
π0.5 checkpoints can declare MEM (short-horizon observation memory) and RTC
(real-time chunking); neither is supported here, and serving such a checkpoint
anyway would produce plausible-looking wrong actions. See
``_reject_unsupported_capabilities``.
