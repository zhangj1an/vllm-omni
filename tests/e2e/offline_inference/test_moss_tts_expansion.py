"""E2E offline inference tests for the MOSS-TTS two-stage pipeline (delay model).

Tests the MossTTSDelayModel path using MOSS-VoiceGenerator (1.7B) — the
smallest MossTTSDelayModel variant — so the test runs on a single A10G or L4
without requiring an 80 GB GPU.

Uses the standard omni_runner + pytestmark pattern (one module-scoped engine
per file, skill invariant I4) — the same harness as the sibling realtime file
test_moss_tts_realtime.py.  Do NOT add a second engine fixture here; that
triggers mid-module teardown races.

    non-empty AND distinct audio.

    This is the regression guard for the batch concurrency bugs: when audio
    codes are broadcast (``audio_codes_list[0]`` for every request) or hidden
    states are sliced with a uniform ``rows_per_req`` division, request 1
    receives request 0's audio. Asserting the waveforms differ catches that.

    The requests must be built through the processor (``_build_voicegen_request``)
    so the differing text actually reaches the talker as ``prompt_token_ids`` —
    a bare assistant prompt would leave every request identical and the bug
    invisible. Audio sampling is seeded (deterministic), so the distinctness
    here reflects genuine per-request content, not RNG noise.

    Coverage limitation — this does NOT exercise the mixed prefill+decode case.
    Both requests are submitted together via ``generate(requests, ...)``, so the
    scheduler prefills then decodes them in lockstep: every step is either
    all-prefill or all-decode, and each request contributes the same number of
    rows. The uniform ``rows_per_req`` fallback in ``_request_row_spans`` happens
    to be exact there, so it would still pass even if ``query_start_loc`` recovery
    were broken. The genuinely dangerous case — request A in decode (1 row) while
    request B prefills (N rows) in the SAME batch, where a uniform split
    misattributes A's hidden states — requires staggered submission (start A,
    let it reach decode, then submit B). The synchronous ``Omni.generate()`` batch
    API cannot inject a request into an in-flight batch, so that path is covered
    only indirectly by the ``query_start_loc`` recovery in ``_request_row_spans``
